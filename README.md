🚗 Smart Adaptive Headlight System (IoT)
📌 Overview

An IoT-based adaptive headlight system that automatically adjusts headlight brightness and beam angle using an LDR sensor to reduce glare from oncoming vehicles and improve nighttime driving safety.

⚙️ Components

Arduino Uno

LDR (Light Sensor)

Servo Motor

LED Headlight

Buck Converter & 12V Power Supply

🔄 Working

LDR detects incoming light intensity

Arduino compares it with a threshold

Servo tilts the headlight and LED brightness is reduced

System restores normal state after glare disappears
